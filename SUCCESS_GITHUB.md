## 🌐 Next Step: Deploy to Streamlit Cloud (5 minutes)

### Why Streamlit Cloud (Not Vercel)?
- **Vercel**: Designed for Next.js/React (JavaScript frameworks) ❌
- **Streamlit Cloud**: Designed specifically for Python Streamlit apps ✅
  - FREE tier is generous
  - Zero configuration needed
  - Auto-deploys on git push
  - Official Streamlit hosting

### Quick Deployment Guide

#### Step 1: Go to Streamlit Cloud
Open your browser and visit:
```
https://share.streamlit.io
```

#### Step 2: Sign In with GitHub
- Click **"Sign in with GitHub"**
- Authorize Streamlit to access your repositories
- This links your GitHub account

#### Step 3: Create New App
1. Click the **"New app"** button (big blue button)
2. You'll see a form with 3 fields:

```
Repository: aladinz/Portfolio_OPT_Engine
Branch: main
Main file path: app.py
```

3. (Optional) Customize your app URL:
   - Default: `aladinz-portfolio-opt-engine.streamlit.app`
   - Custom: Choose something like `portfolio-optimizer`

#### Step 4: Deploy!
- Click **"Deploy!"** button
- Watch the deployment logs (2-3 minutes)
- Your app will automatically:
  - Install Python 3.11
  - Install all packages from requirements.txt
  - Start the Streamlit server
  - Generate your public URL

#### Step 5: Access Your App
Once deployed, you'll get a URL like:
