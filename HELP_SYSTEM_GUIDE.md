## 🎓 Learning Path for Beginners

### Step 1: Start with MPT Basics
1. Open sidebar
2. Expand "📚 Learn About Optimization Strategies"
3. Read the Modern Portfolio Theory overview
4. Understand: risk-return tradeoff, diversification, efficient frontier

### Step 2: Choose Your Strategy
1. Read about each strategy using the "ℹ️ About..." expanders
2. Compare:
   - **Conservative?** → Minimum Volatility
   - **Balanced?** → Maximum Sharpe Ratio or Risk Parity
   - **Aggressive?** → Maximum Return (with constraints!)
   - **Simple?** → Equal Weight
3. Select your strategy

### Step 3: Set Up Constraints
1. Expand "📖 Constraints Guide"
2. Find your portfolio size (3-5, 6-7, or 8-10 assets)
3. Use recommended min/max percentages
4. Verify feasibility (min × number of assets ≤ 100%)

### Step 4: Run Optimization
1. Click "🚀 Optimize Portfolio"
2. Review results

### Step 5: Understand Your Metrics
1. Expand "📖 Understanding Portfolio Metrics"
2. Look up each metric shown in your results
3. Check if your values are in good ranges:
   - Sharpe Ratio: >1.0 = good
   - Diversification: 85+ = excellent
   - Max Drawdown: <20% = moderate risk

### Step 6: Review AI Insights
1. Expand "📖 Understanding AI Insights & Health Score"
2. Check your health score (70+ = solid, 80+ = excellent)
3. Read through each insight category:
   - 💪 **Strengths**: What you're doing right
   - ⚠️ **Risk Alerts**: Critical issues to address
   - 💡 **Recommendations**: How to improve
4. If score <70, review the improvement roadmap
5. Implement high-priority actions first

### Step 7: Explore Advanced Features
1. **Monte Carlo**: Project future portfolio values
2. **Strategy Comparison**: See all 4 strategies side-by-side
3. **Rebalancing**: Track drift and get trade recommendations

## 💡 Quick Tips

### For Quick Answers
- **"What does Sharpe Ratio mean?"** → Main dashboard → "Understanding Portfolio Metrics"
- **"When should I use Risk Parity?"** → Sidebar → "About Risk Parity"
- **"How do I set constraints?"** → Sidebar → "Constraints Guide"
- **"What's my health score?"** → Main → "Understanding AI Insights"
- **"How does Monte Carlo work?"** → Main → "Understanding Monte Carlo Simulation"

### For In-Depth Learning
1. **Start with**: MPT Overview (sidebar)
2. **Then read**: Each strategy explanation
3. **Understand**: All metrics (main dashboard)
4. **Apply**: Constraints guide principles
5. **Analyze**: AI Insights guide interpretation

### For Practical Application
1. **Portfolio Setup**: Follow portfolio size guidelines (3-10 assets)
2. **Constraints**: Use 8-20% for 8-10 assets, 10-25% for 5-7 assets
3. **Strategy**: Start with Risk Parity or Max Sharpe for balanced approach
4. **Rebalancing**: Annual for taxable accounts, quarterly for IRAs
5. **Monitoring**: Check health score, aim for 70+ (B grade or better)
